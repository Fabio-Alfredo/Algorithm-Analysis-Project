# Algorithm-Analysis-Project

Welcome to the Huffman Coding Project repository! This project is structured in four stages, each of which focuses on different aspects of Huffman coding and tree construction.

## [Stage I] 
involves researching and becoming familiar with the Arabic alphabet. Symbols are selected, a probability is assigned to each, and a short report is generated.

## [Stage II]  
shifts focus to implementing functions to construct binary tree nodes for each symbol, laying the foundation for the Huffman algorithm. A priority queue that uses a minimal heap is also implemented.

## [Stage III] 
delves into the Huffman Algorithm itself. Research is carried out, the history, steps and performance of the algorithm in different scenarios are documented and analyzed. This stage provides a comprehensive understanding of Huffman coding.

## [Stage IV] 
is the implementation phase, where the information and structures created in previous stages are used to implement the Huffman algorithm in C++, thus generating an efficient and functional coding solution.
